I really enjoyed using "vi" but that may be due to the fact that by the time I got to use vi, I was more used to using command line text editors.
What I really like about vi is that there are different modes- command and insert. The modes helped a lot because in other editors, I would jump from file to file and end up pressing a few buttons that would change the file.
The thing I don't like about editors, and this is strictly due to being spoiled with Word, Google Docs, and VS Code, is how much more work is required to initially get used to vi, emacs, and nano.
I imagine with practice and time, using command line editors becomes more natural and with basic short cuts and commands memorized, a lot more easier to use.
